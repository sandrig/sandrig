### Hi there! My name is Andrey Savelev

I’m a software engineer with 6+ years of extensive experience. I specialize in front-end development, but I have little experience writing back-end services in NodeJS (NestJS), Java (Spring Boot), Python (Django, Flask, FastAPI).

I help companies develop, release and maintain their projects.

My professional interests are quite broad and include software architecture, cloud technologies, type systems, сybersecurity – to name just a few.

### Tech Stack

React, TypeScript, Zustand/Mobx/Redux, GraphQL, Docker, NodeJS, NestJS, HTML, CSS, Git
